<h2>4. What we do with your data</h2>
<p>We use your information under our legitimate interests to help us understand how our websites are effectively serving our users, and to make improvements. We use Google Analytics software to analyse our digital performance, or to assess the popularity of our campaigns. 
For more information on how we use your personal information in relation to Google Analytics, please view our cookie policy. You can opt-out of the collection of information for such purposes here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices </p>
<p>We gather information on whether you have received or interacted with emails that we send. This helps us improve our content and deliver more relevant emails to you. </p>
<p>We also monitor our social media performance and may store content you have posted on social networks, along with your social network identity to understand responses to our campaigns and improve our content, or to reply to users with queries about topics related to us.</p>
<p>We use your information to fulfil any contract you make with us and supply you with the information or services that you want to use. This may include for example joining a mailing list, creating an account or personal profile page, recording your signature as part of a petition, or making a purchase. We may also use your information to notify you about important changes or developments to the website or our services. </p>
<p>To provide you with these services, we may sometimes need to contact you. That would most likely be by email, but could be by post, telephone, instant message or SMS text message, depending on the situation. For example, we may contact you if it appears you are having problems creating an account, or to ask for more detail on a comment you make. </p>
<p>We collect and use personal information that you submit via our websites, based on your consent to use our services and receive contact from us. The information you provide will enable us to send you direct marketing and information regarding our campaigns, activities and services; or to contact you for your views on our services and participation in campaign activities. </p>
<p>If you join a mailing list or group that we operate, we will send you communications through the channels you have consented to / selected.

Please note that we may not be able to continue providing particular services to you if you request that we do not contact you. </p>
<p>We store data on preferences that you submit to us, or from campaign actions you take with us, to help us send you information that more closely matches your interests, or to follow up on issues you have been involved in. We also use consent to process case studies you provide us with, or individual photos of you. </p>
<p>We may also contact you, or permit selected third parties (such as the individual trade unions that are affiliated to the TUC) to contact you, by post, telephone, SMS text message and e-mail about other goods or services which you may be interested in. We’ll only do this if you have explicitly consented to it by ticking the relevant boxes on the forms we use to collect your data or by confirming this to us directly in writing. </p>
