title: 'Food manufacturing shows why Risk Assessments are no substitute for
unions'
date_published: February 2021

Protection from Covid outbreaks in food manufacturing sites is best
achieved by an active workplace union alongside a comprehensive employer
risk assessment policy.

With refrigeration units pumping cold air down lines, noisy machinery
forcing people to shout, difficulties in maintaining distance on
production lines, poor sick pay policies and groups of workers often
travelling in collective transport, food manufacturing -- and meat
processing plants in particular - have been badly affected during the
pandemic.

In just the last two months, the following incidences were reported:

-   January 2021

    -   The 2 Sisters poultry plant in Coupar Angus was continuing work
        as normal despite 5 workers testing positive for Covid. Last
        August the site in South Lanarkshire had to halt production for
        2 weeks after a number of employees caught the virus.

-   December 2020

    -   Greencore's Manton Wood facility in Bassetlaw Nottingham was hit
        by Covid.

    -   79 positive tests after [an
        outbreak](https://www.standard.co.uk/business/bakkavor-factory-coronavirus-death-gmb-b129148.html)
        at Bakkavor's Tilmanstone plant in the South East. A worker died
        following the outbreak, as well as two who has previously died
        of the disease there. There are 900 workers at the factory which
        manufactures salad products.

    -   An Irthlingborough food production company has confirmed that
        employees have tested positive for Covid-19. Whitworths, based
        in Wellingborough Road, specialises in dried fruits, nuts and
        seeds for snacking and baking.

    -   Eight workers at the Farne Salmon plant in Duns, in the borders,
        have tested positive for Covid-19

The real picture could be even worse. A recent
[report](http://www.pirc.co.uk/?p=1446) showed that unscrupulous
employers were reporting Covid-19 infections at food factories as
'community cases' rather than workplace cases to the HSE's Riddor
reporting system.

There is also fear amongst the workforce about speaking out about
conditions. Another disturbing report in Personnel Today revealed that
one-fifth of employees found themselves out of a job after making their
fears known or asking too many questions. In one case, an employee at a
meat processing plant was told not to wear a face mask at work and when
he raised concerns about the lack of social distancing, he was
dismissed.

## Union success

However, it's not all doom and gloom. In January 2020 workers from the
Greencore Moulton Park food processing factory were named as 'unsung
heroes' of the pandemic by Northamptonshire County Council.

The members of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) were
acknowledged for their efforts to improve staff safety, after the
factory, which makes products for Marks & Spencer's, was hit by a major
Covid 19 outbreak in August 2020. Nearly 300 staff got sick during the
outbreak, which was the second to occur at the site.

After the crisis, the on-site union ramped up its activities producing
safety notices, leaflets and Facebook statements in different languages,
and holding weekly health and safety meetings. The aim was to ensure
compliance with the company's risk assessment policies and that there
were no further outbreaks.

Describing the \"Rose of Northamptonshire Award\" as "historical", BFAWU
branch secretary George Atwell said: \"The union and its members have
worked tremendously hard this year and I\'m privileged to represent this
site and the branch. Our members have worked extremely hard to tackle
the pandemic and work with the company to support workers."

## A general lack of transparency around risks

Whilst the Moulton Park factory mentioned above was not the only site
owned by Greencore Group, a major producer of convenience foods, to have
suffered an outbreak, the company has at least been clear about its
policy for controlling the spread of Covid.

While it is low on procedural detail and does not state who will be
responsible for its implementation, it has at least made it public. It
lists measures the company will take to maintain social distancing and
protect worker wellbeing, control contagion risk via reducing contact
during travel and supplier visits, as well as how it aims to implement
the measures through a new management standard and governance.

However, this is still highly unusual, despite the many outbreaks in the
food industry. Of six other major UK food companies where there have
been Covid outbreaks only one has made a Risk Assessment public.

## The importance of unions

The work by the Bakers' union members at the Greencore plant is evidence
that a transparent Risk Assessment policy, while important, is not
enough on its own. An active site-based union is a vital defence against
risks to health and safety, as well as the means for guaranteeing
Covid-secure policies are fully implemented. The sector is not heavily
unionised, though GMB, Unite and BFAWU all have recognitions or
membership across a number of major food employers. All have been
actively organising to improve safety during the pandemic, and this
shows in the results they have been able to achieve for members.

Recent wins by unions on this issue include Unite members winning full
pay for self-isolating at a Bakkavor plant in Newark. Around 150 workers
previously only received Statutory Sick Pay of £95.85 a week forcing
many to work when potentially affected. Now, after pressure from the
union, all 1600 workers at the plant will receive their full basic pay
for the two weeks they are off. GMB have also won similar increases at
the Bakkavor plant in Dover following a serious outbreak last year.In
another example, following a health and safety scare at the Gainsborough
site of Nobel Foods early on in the pandemic, workers got organised also
with Unite and won trade union recognition, giving them a solid voice in
what happens to them down the line.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, unions have also pushed the
government to do more to enforce the two metre rule in food processing,
but government advice has not made this mandatory on production lines
for example.

As TUC General Secretary Frances O\'Grady says: "Ministers urgently need
to update the guidance for food production. They must require employers
to publish their risk assessments. And they must resource the HSE
properly, so it can get into food factories and crack down on unsafe
working."
