<h2>4. What we do with your data</h2>

For more information on how we use your personal information in relation to Google Analytics, please view our cookie policy. You can opt-out of the collection of information for such purposes here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices </p>
<p>We gather information on whether you have received or interacted with emails that we send. This helps us improve our content and deliver more relevant emails to you. </p>
<p>We also monitor our social media performance and may store content you have posted on social networks, along with your social network identity to understand responses to our campaigns and improve our content, or to reply to users with queries about topics related to us.</p>
<p>We use your information to fulfil any contract you make with us and supply you with the information or services that you want to use. This may include for example joining a mailing list, creating an account or personal profile page, recording your signature as part of a petition, or making a purchase. We may also use your information to notify you about important changes or developments to the website or our services. </p>
<p>To provide you with these services, we may sometimes need to contact you. That would most likely be by email, but could be by post, telephone, instant message or SMS text message, depending on the situation. For example, we may contact you if it appears you are having problems creating an account, or to ask for more detail on a comment you make. </p>
<p>We collect and use personal information that you submit via our websites, based on your consent to use our services and receive contact from us.
